### ðŸ§© Form Structure

- **Step 1: Publisher Info**
- **Step 2: PIC & Affiliations**

Users can navigate between steps using:

- `Next` and `Previous` buttons

Each step includes form validation. When the **Next** or **Save** button is clicked:

- The current step is validated using **React Hook Form** and **Zod**
- If validation passes, the data is saved to **Redux**

### ðŸ“‚ Folder Descriptions

- **`apis/`**
  Contains all API interaction logic, such as Axios instances and service functions.

- **`components/`**
  Reusable UI components that are shared across multiple pages (e.g., `Input`, `Button`, `Stepper`, etc.).

- **`constants/`**
  Includes values that don't change, such as enums, dummy options, stepper configurations.

- **`hooks/`**
  Custom logic extracted into hooks for cleaner and more reusable code (e.g., `useClickOutside`, `useAppSelector`).

- **`pages/`**
  Each file/folder here represents a main page or route.
  Inside each page, there is a `_components/` folder that contains **private, page-specific components**. These components are **only used within that page**, and not shared globally.

- **`schemas/`**
  Contains form validation schemas defined with Zod.

- **`stores/`**
  Redux store configuration and slices used for managing global state, such as multi-step form data.

- **`types/`**
  TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for consistent typing across the project.
